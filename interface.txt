What I want this interactive app to be able to do...


Print optins of the bash script to use
for example

"SELECT ONE
(1) - Twitter Grep
(2) - Manual
(3) - Help
(4) - Exit
Choice >"


if user inputs incorrect, it will clear the console and reprint the whole thing

after they pick an option, it will go into sub script
for example they chose twitter Grep

"Input the paths you would like to grep for on twitter then say DONE"
> path
> /path2
> DONE"

"Ok... Running Script... (prints the dots, then deletes them, then prints them again)"
^^ should run concurrently as the bash script executes
